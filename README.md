<h1>Security-Monitoring</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
As part of my cybersecurity and cloud computing apprenticeship, I implemented a security monitoring system on AWS. This project aimed to detect and alert on critical changes in the AWS environment, including the deletion of S3 buckets, which can indicate a malicious action or a misconfiguration.
<br />


<h2> Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>CloudTrail</b> 
- <b>CloudWatch</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>AWS console</b> 

<h2>Steps walk-through:</h2>


-<b>Enable AWS CloudTrail to track AWS resource activities and changes.</b>

-<b>Configure a CloudWatch Log Group to store CloudTrail logs.</b>

-<b>Create a metric filter on CloudWatch to detect S3 bucket deletion.</b>

-<b>Test the solution and verify the alerts are working correctly.</b>

-<b>Configure a CloudWatch Log Group to store CloudTrail logs</b>
